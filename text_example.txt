A DRINKING SONG by W.B.Yeats

Wine Comes in at the mouth
And love comes in at the eye;
That's all we shall know for thruth
Before we grow old and die.
I lift the glass to my mouth,
I look at you, and I sigh.

> a personal note: similar tone can be read in Omar Khayyam's poetry

THE RUBAIYAT, by Omar Khayyam
Written 1120 A.C.E.

Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,
Before we too into the Dust descend;
Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lie
Sans Wine, sans Song, sand Singer, and--sans End!
