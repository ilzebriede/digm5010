This academic research paper describes an Internet-based interactive artwork called VERBARIUM (1999) created in order to model and simulate creative emergence based on participator engagement and interactions. The principle discussed for catalising interconnectedness and collective co-creating are phase transitions (Complex systems theory); a balance act and the midpoint between order and disorder, stability and flexibility, intent and meaning. In VERBARIUM an input digital text gets transformed into 3D form, then added and stored with a collective image transforming and evolving overtime. The process is supported by specially designed text-to-form editor that morphs and growcs 8 vertices ring into complex growing structure.

> The idea about computer-man symbiotic work practice where a machine takes over technical tasks while the human mind can engage more freely with the generation of ideas. A need to create a methodology where man and machine meet in productive collaborative space, able to communicate back and forth each other findings and needs. Dissimilarity and potential supplementation between man and machinic thinking. Challenges: language to aid two-way translation between parties,
"To bring computing machines effectively into processes of thinking that must go on in "real time," time that moves too fast to permit using computers in conventional ways." 
"If computer thinking could be introduced effectively into the thought process, the functions that can be performed by data-processing machines would improve or facilitate thinking and problem solving in an important way."
My personal thoughts: This article was originally written in 1960, and it paints the future we already reached. The question about human-computer symbiosis is still relevant, and it hasn't been answered in the past 60 years. The computers have evolved as we have developed ways to interact with them. However, computers and computational programs are still solving problems. Symbiotic relationships can harness different interaction outcomes, and there are classified eight such interaction modules. What Licklider was suggesting by offering a fig tree and *Blastonphaga grossorum* insect example, is a mutualistic relationship where both agencies benefit from each other. It seems to me that only humans have profited from computers, and it is hard to talk about mutual inter-relationship as computers are not independent agents, but programmed and constructed by humans. Additionally, Lickider suggests that "computer [...] will accept a clearly secondary status" in decision making and recognising relevance. If this type of relationship is formed where human will take an upper-hand, doesn't it question and distrusts the computational process to be equally relevant and important? Machine learning is operating on given data that becomes it's learned memory. Even though neural networks of computerised systems are built inspired by brain neural networks, we are still learning to understand how decisions are formed in unsupervised computerised systems. We have created something that we do not understand ourselves, and that has become a subject of inquiry in itself. We feed computers data that represents humans in the hope that they will form a sort of essence or ways to reflect on our ways or show something that we didn't know. If we feed computer algorithms known and existing data, how can they create something novel? Aren't we making an echo-chamber of our world, transmitted, recycled and rebuilt by machine? How can this data exchange benefit us and computers in general? 
Symbiosis is described as "cooperative "living together" in intimate association, or even close union, of two dissimilar organisms" ("Welister's New International Dictionary," 2n(l e(i., G. and C.Mlerriam Co., Springfield, Mass., p. 2555; 1958.) The keyword here is *intimate*, suggesting a close, personal and mutually understanding connection and exchange. Is it possible to build an intimate and close inter-personal relation between human and machine?
